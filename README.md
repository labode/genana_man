# Manual generation reader
Tool to combine https://github.com/phcerdan/SGEXT generation output with https://github.com/labode/genana_py id assignment for further statistical analysis

## How does it work?
Reads two .nrrds of the same graph with different labels and creates an Id/Gen mapping

## Requirements
Required packages are listed in requirements.txt and can be installed using pip as follows:\
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Inputs:
- .nrrd generated by genana_py containing graph w. label ids
- .nrrd generated by sggen containing graph w. generation numbers

## Output:
- .csv containing id/gen matching

## Usage
`python3 genana_man.py -i id.nrrd -g gen.nrrd -f outputfile`
